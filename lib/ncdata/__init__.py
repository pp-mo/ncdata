"""
An abstract representation of Netcdf data with groups, variables + attributes.

As provided by the NetCDF "Common Data Model" :
https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-java/5.3/userguide/common_data_model_overview.html

It is also provided with read/write conversion interfaces to Xarray, Iris and netCDF4,
thus acting as an efficient exchange channel between any of those forms.
