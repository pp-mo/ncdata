ncdata
======
NetCDF data interoperability.

Represents generic netcdf data in Python objects, with translation to and from common
analysis packages, so that netcdf-based data can be freely exchanged between packages
without data copying, and data storage formatting can be precisely controlled.

In particular Ncdata exchanges data **between Xarray and Iris** as efficiently as
possible.

   "lossless, copy-free and lazy-preserving".

This enables the user to freely mix+match operations from both projects, getting the
"best of both worlds".
