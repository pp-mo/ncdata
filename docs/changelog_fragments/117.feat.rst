Added the ".avals" property as an easier way of managing attributes:
This provides a simple "name: value" map, bypassing the NcAttribute objects and converting values to and from simple Python equivalents.
This effectively replaces the older 'set_attrval' and 'get_attrval', which will eventually be removed.
