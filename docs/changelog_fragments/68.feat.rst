Added the ability to extract a sub-region by indexing/slicing over dimensions.
The :class:`ncdata.NcData` objects can be indexed with the ``[]`` operation, or over
specifed dimensions with the :meth:`~ncdata.NcData.slicer` method.
This is based on the new :meth:`~ncdata.utils.index_by_dimensions()` utility method
and :class:`~ncdata.utils.Slicer` class.
